# slap

## Slackware package explorer

Works pretty well, but it is not finished yet.
I intent to add GUI too (that is why I wrote in PASCAL);
export to SQL script;
and more...

What it does until now:

* Supports slackpkg and [slackpkg+](http://slakfinder.org/slackpkg+.html)
* Loads all package information into binary tree
* Searchs by using regular expressions (PCRE)

Use `slap -h` for help
